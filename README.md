Personal blog

For this project I made a personal blog to share my personal thoughts on all things that interest me in the nerd and pop culture.
The way it works is I would sign in and post different blogs. The approach I took was to determine the relationships of tables for the database and link them. Even though I have three tables one for users, blogs, and comments. I am only using users and blogs for now for the sake of time and hitting all the CRUD requiremnts. When I have more time I will have the comments table be used so that everyone that signs in on the web page will have the ability to create comments on each blog.

User Stories

As the owner of the blog, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete blogs.
As a signed in user of the page I would like to be able to sign in and post comments.
As a not signed in viewer of the page I want to be able to view blogs and comments.
